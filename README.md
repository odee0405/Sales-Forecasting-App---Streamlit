# Sales-Forecasting-App---Streamlit

## Introduction

Hello! My name is SHIMWA Agape Valentin, and I'm excited to share with you this project that demonstrates how to build user-friendly web interfaces for Machine Learning models. We'll explore two popular frameworks: Gradio and Streamlit. These frameworks enable us to create interactive web apps that make interacting with ML models more intuitive and enjoyable compared to traditional notebooks.

## Description

This project's goal is to guide you through the process of creating your own user interfaces that interact with Machine Learning models. It starts with a basic demo using Gradio & Streamlit to ensure that everything is set up correctly. Your task will be to expand on this foundation by:

- Passing values through the interface.
- Processing the values in the backend.
- Submitting processed values to the ML model for predictions.
- Displaying the predictions on the interface.

## Instructions

I've divided the project into several steps:

1. **Build a Streamlit App:
2. **Build a Gradio App
